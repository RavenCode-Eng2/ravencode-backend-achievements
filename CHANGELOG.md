## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- **StandardResponse class** for consistent API response format across all endpoints
- **Enhanced Achievement model** with new fields:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each achievement
  - `score` and `total_points`: Detailed scoring information
  - `percentage`: Auto-calculated completion percentage
  - `date_earned`: Timestamp when achievement was earned
  - `status`: Achievement status (completed, in_progress, failed, pending)
  - `metadata`: Additional data like XP, category, difficulty
- **Enhanced Student model** with tracking fields:
  - `total_xp`: Accumulated experience points
  - `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamp tracking
  - Helper methods for XP calculation and achievement filtering
- **New API endpoints**:
  - `GET /achievements/{email}/stats`: Detailed achievement statistics
  - `GET /achievements/course/{course_id}/available`: Available achievements for a course
  - `POST /achievements/bulk-update`: Bulk achievement updates
  - `DELETE /achievements/{email}/{achievement_name}`: Delete specific achievements
- **Enhanced validation** with Pydantic validators:
  - Email format validation
  - Score vs total points validation
  - Achievement name validation
  - Auto-calculation of percentages and status
- **Custom exception handling** with specific error types:
  - `AchievementNotFound`, `StudentNotFound`, `InvalidAchievementData`
  - `DatabaseConnectionError`, `DuplicateAchievementError`
  - Global exception handlers with proper HTTP status codes
- **Database optimization**:
  - Automatic index creation for performance
  - Compound indexes on email + achievement_name
  - Indexes on course_id, status, date_earned, achieved status
  - Database initialization script
- **Comprehensive testing** with `test_api.py` script
- **Startup script** (`startup.py`) for automated initialization
- **Enhanced API documentation** with detailed OpenAPI specs

### Changed
- **API version upgraded** from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0
- **All endpoints now return standardized responses** with `data`, `message`, and `success` fields
- **Achievement creation logic** now includes automatic UUID generation
- **Improved error messages** with specific error types and helpful context
- **Enhanced database operations** with better error handling and validation
- **Updated requirements.txt** with specific package versions and new dependencies

### Enhanced
- **Root endpoint** (`/`) now provides API information and available endpoints
- **Health check endpoint** (`/health`) includes version and timestamp information
- **Achievement update logic** with better validation and automatic field calculation
- **Service layer** with comprehensive error handling and input validation

### Fixed
- **Database connection error handling** with proper exception raising
- **Achievement validation** to prevent invalid data entry
- **Email validation** with proper error messages
- **Memory optimization** in database queries and operations

### Technical Improvements
- **Modular exception handling** with reusable exception classes
- **Type hints** throughout the codebase for better development experience
- **Logging integration** for better debugging and monitoring
- **Background index creation** to avoid blocking operations
- **Proper HTTP status codes** for different error scenarios

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- Initial project structure with FastAPI framework
- MongoDB database connection setup
- Achievement and Student models with Pydantic
- Achievement service with logic for 80% threshold
- API endpoints for updating and retrieving achievements
- CORS middleware configuration
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions

### Fixed
- PyMongo boolean evaluation issues with Database and Collection objects
- Email validation dependency requirements
- Import errors and module structure

## Version History

- **2.0.0**: Major enhancement with standardized responses, new endpoints, enhanced validation, database optimization, and comprehensive error handling
- **1.0.0**: Initial release with core achievement management functionality

## Migration Guide (1.0.0 â†’ 2.0.0)

### Breaking Changes
- All API responses now use the StandardResponse format with `data`, `message`, and `success` fields
- Achievement model has new required fields that will be auto-populated for existing records

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing API endpoints maintain the same URLs and basic functionality
- Old achievement records will be automatically enhanced with new fields when accessed
- Frontend applications should expect the new response format but existing data structures remain compatible
